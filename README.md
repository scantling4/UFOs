# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap to create an interactive webpage based on data collected on UFO sightings. The dynamic table allows users to filter their searches based on different criteria: the date, city, state, country, and shape of the sightings. 

## Results:
In order to perform a search, one can type a date, city, state, country, or shape into one of the boxes underneath the “Filter Search” header. In the screenshot below, the data was filtered on the date: 1/1/2010, the city: el cajon, and the shape: triangle.

## Summary: 

One drawback of this webpage is that the user would have to scroll through all of the data to see what the possible filter options are. A dropdown menu for each of the filters may be a useful fix to this problem. Additionally, there is not much additional information provided on the webpage. It would be useful to have a map of where these sightings were and possibly other articles that talk about UFO sightings. These could both be accomplished by adding additional links in the navigation bar.
